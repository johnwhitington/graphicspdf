graphics primitives. *)

exception Graphic_failure of string
(** Raised by the functions below when they encounter an error. *)

(** {6 Initializations} *)

val open_pdf : string -> unit
(** Open a PDF file for writing. This, or [open_pdf_channel] should be called before each invocation of [open_graph]. The file will be written upon [close_graph]. *)

val open_pdf_channel : out_channel -> unit
(** The same, but using an OCaml channel. *)

val open_graph : string -> unit
(** Start the graphics mode. The page is cleared and the current point is set
to (0, 0). The string argument is used to pass optional information on the
graphics size (using the X Windows geometry convention).  If the empty string
is given, a sensible default is selected. *)

val close_graph : unit -> unit
(** Emits the PDF document to the file or channel corresponding to the program
execution. Closes the PDF output channel or. *)

val clear_graph : unit -> unit
(** Clear the graphics window. This throws all existing commands away, but
doesn't reset any state (such as current point). *)

val set_window_title : string -> unit
(** Sets the title of the PDF document. *)

val size_x : unit -> int
val size_y : unit -> int
(** Returns the size of the graphics page. Coordinates of the page
   range over [0 .. size_x () - 1] and [0 .. size_y () - 1].
   Drawings outside of this rectangle are clipped, without causing
   an error. The origin (0, 0) is at the lower left corner. *)

(** {6 Colors} *)

type color = int
(** A color is specified by its R, G, B components. Each component
   is in the range [0..255]. The three components are packed in
   an [int]: [0xRRGGBB], where [RR] are the two hexadecimal digits for
   the red component, [GG] for the green component, [BB] for the
   blue component. *)

val rgb : int -> int -> int -> color
(** [rgb r g b] returns the integer encoding the color with red
   component [r], green component [g], and blue component [b].
   [r], [g] and [b] are in the range [0..255]. *)

val set_color : color -> unit 
(** Set the current drawing color. *)

val background : color
val foreground : color
(** Default background and foreground colors (usually, either black
   foreground on a white background or white foreground on a
   black background).
   [clear_graph] fills the page with the [background] color.
   The initial drawing color is [foreground]. *)

   current point translated of the given vector,
   and move the current point to this point. *)

val curveto : int * int -> int * int -> int * int -> unit
(** [curveto b c d] draws a cubic Bezier curve starting from
   the current point to point [d], with control points [b] and
   [c], and moves the current point to [d]. *)

val draw_rect : int -> int -> int -> int -> unit
(** [draw_rect x y w h] draws the rectangle with lower left corner
   at [x,y], width [w] and height [h].
   The current point is unchanged. *)

val draw_poly_line : (int * int) array -> unit
(** [draw_poly_line points] draws the line that joins the
   points given by the array argument.
   The array contains the coordinates of the vertices of the
   polygonal line, which need not be closed.
   The current point is unchanged. *)

val draw_poly : (int * int) array -> unit
(** Draw the given polygon with the current color. The array
   contains the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon.
   The current point is unchanged. *)

val draw_segments : (int * int * int * int) array -> unit
(** [draw_segments segments] draws the segments given in the array
   argument. Each segment is specified as a quadruple
   [(x0, y0, x1, y1)] where [(x0, y0)] and [(x1, y1)] are
   the coordinates of the end points of the segment.
   The current point is unchanged. *)

val draw_arc :
  int -> int -> int -> int -> int -> int -> unit
(** NOT IMPLEMENTED. [draw_arc x y rx ry a1 a2] draws an elliptical arc with center
   [x,y], horizontal radius [rx], vertical radius [ry], from angle
   [a1] to angle [a2] (in degrees). The current point is unchanged. *)

val draw_ellipse : int -> int -> int -> int -> unit

(** {6 Text drawing} *)

val draw_char : char -> unit
val draw_string : string -> unit

   to the lower right corner of the text drawn. *)

val set_font : string -> unit
val set_text_size : int -> unit
(** Set the font and character size used for drawing text.
   The interpretation of the arguments to [set_font] and
   [set_text_size] is implementation-dependent.
   Fonts [Times], [Courier] and [Helvetica] are recognized.
   You may also use modifiers [Bold], [Italic], and
   [BoldItalic] (hence [Times-Bold], [Times-Italic],
   [Times-BoldItalic] are valid font names). *)

val text_size : string -> int * int
(** Return the dimensions of the given text, if it were drawn with
   the current font and size. *)

(** {6 Filling} *)

(** Fill the given polygon with the current color. The array
   contains the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon. *)

(** {6 Images} *)

type image
(** The abstract type for images, in internal representation.
   Externally, images are represented as matrices of colors.
   Only here for compatibility. Drawing of images is not yet
   implemented. *)

val transp : color
(** In matrices of colors, this color represents a ``transparent''
   point: when drawing the corresponding image, all pixels on the
   screen corresponding to a transparent pixel in the image will
   not be modified, while other points will be set to the color
   of the corresponding point in the image. This allows superimposing
   an image over an existing background. *)
